1. Subqueries
   Queries embedded into other queries
   
   ex1 : need to know the region each customers is
       from who has had an order with freight over 100
   
   SELECT  CustomerID
          ,CompanyName
          ,Region
   FROM   Customers
   WHERE  customerID  in (SELECT        <- subqueries
   customerID
          FROM  Orders
          WHERE Freight > 100);
   
   ex2 : 
   
   -- 3) customer information for those orders
   SELECT  Customer_name
          ,Customer_contact
   FROM    Customers
   WHERE   cust_id IN
        -- 2) customer id's for those orders
        SELECT  customer_id
        FROM    Orders
        WHERE   order_number IN (SELECT order_number
        -- 1) order numbers for toothbrush
            FROM   OrderItems
                WHERE   prod_name = 'Toothbrush');
   
   ex3 :
   
   SELECT COUNT (*) AS orders
   FROM   Orders
   WHERE  customer_id = '143569';
   
   SELECT customer_name
          ,customer_state
          (SELECT COUNT (*) AS orders
          FROM    Orders
          WHERE   Orders.customer_id = Customer.customer_id) AS orders
   FROM   customers
   ORDER BY  Customer_name
    
2. Cartesian joins
   each row from the first table joins with all the rows of another table
   
   ex :

   SELECT  product_name
           ,unit_price
           ,company_name
   FROM    suppliers CROSS JOIN products;
     
3. Inner joins
   select records that have matching values in both tables
   
   ex :
   
   SELECT  suppliers.CompanyName
           ,ProductName
           ,UnitPrice
   FROM    Suppliers INNER JOIN Products
   ON  Suppliers.supplierid = Products.supplierid
      
4. Aliases and self joins
5. Advanced joins: Left, Right, and Full outer joins
6. Unions
